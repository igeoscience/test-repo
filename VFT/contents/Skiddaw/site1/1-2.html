    This site, Site 1, is a small, disused quarry in the Skiddaw Group sedimentary rocks. How might you start investigating this exposure?
  It's tempting to throw yourself straight at the rocks and start making observations of detailed features. But as the checklist for this site suggests, it's often more productive to stand back and observe the exposure as a whole first. Making a sketch in your notebook of the main features helps focus this exercise. This field sketch should be a fairly simple line drawing that picks out important geological structures such as the fine traces of slaty cleavage cutting across this exposure at a shallow angle. Don't forget to indicate the scale and orientation of your sketch.
  Move up to the rock face to identify smaller-scale features such as colour variation, sedimentary and deformation structures, fossils, and perhaps even coarse crystals or detrital grains.  You may find a small rock specimen to pick up and examine close up.  Record any observations in your notebook, including small thumbnail sketches of specific features, and add further annotations and details to your sketch of the whole exposure. Look out for a chance to use the Virtual Microscope so you can describe microscopic textures in the rock.
  As you record your observations, you may start to make interpretations about the rocks: what sort of rocks they are, which processes created or modified them, and whether they provide clues to past environments. When you record these interpretations in your notebook, make sure you distinguish them clearly from the factual observations you have made.
