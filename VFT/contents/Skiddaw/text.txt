Please listen to or carefully read the following instructions. They contain important information that you will need in order to complete the required tasks.


Skiddaw
There are two main types of rock in the Skiddaw field area: a pile of sedimentary rocks known as the Skiddaw Group, and a single igneous rock, the Skiddaw granite, that intruded those sedimentary rocks around 400 million years ago. The Skiddaw Group was deposited on the seafloor of the Iapetus Ocean nearly half a billion years ago as a thick succession of mudstones, siltstones and gritty sandstones. These sediments were eroded from a small continent called Avalonia, which lay just to the south. 
Not long after the sediments were laid down, the Iapetus Ocean narrowed and then closed completely, as Avalonia collided with another continent called Laurentia, forming a range of mountains. The Skiddaw Group rocks were caught in the middle of this collision. They were deformed, buried several kilometres deep and gradually heated up. The mudstones changed into slates as a result of this regional metamorphism.
After the collision, molten rock rose from deep in the crust as magma and intruded the Skiddaw Group slates.  The magma cooled and crystallized, forming the Skiddaw Granite.  As the magma cooled, it lost heat into the nearby Skiddaw Group sedimentary rocks.  This heat caused new minerals to grow in the sedimentary rocks, a process known as contact metamorphism.
You can gather detailed evidence from exposures in this environment to explore:
- First, the effects of contact and regional metamorphism of the Skiddaw Group sedimentary rocks;
- Second, how the Skiddaw Group rocks were deformed during the mountain-building event.


Site 1 - Blease Fell Quarry
You have now arrived at Blease Fell Quarry. A short briefing on how to investigate this site will follow.


Site 1 - Blease Fell Quarry
This site, Site 1, is a small, disused quarry in the Skiddaw Group sedimentary rocks. How might you start investigating this exposure?
It's tempting to throw yourself straight at the rocks and start making observations of detailed features. But as the checklist for this site suggests, it's often more productive to stand back and observe the exposure as a whole first. Making a sketch in your notebook of the main features helps focus this exercise. This field sketch should be a fairly simple line drawing that picks out important geological structures such as the fine traces of slaty cleavage cutting across this exposure at a shallow angle. Don't forget to indicate the scale and orientation of your sketch.
Move up to the rock face to identify smaller-scale features such as colour variation, sedimentary and deformation structures, fossils, and perhaps even coarse crystals or detrital grains.  You may find a small rock specimen to pick up and examine close up.  Record any observations in your notebook, including small thumbnail sketches of specific features, and add further annotations and details to your sketch of the whole exposure. Look out for a chance to use the Virtual Microscope so you can describe microscopic textures in the rock.
As you record your observations, you may start to make interpretations about the rocks: what sort of rocks they are, which processes created or modified them, and whether they provide clues to past environments. When you record these interpretations in your notebook, make sure you distinguish them clearly from the factual observations you have made.


Instructions
Now examine the hand specimen in detail, as if with a hand lens.  You can rotate the rock round and over using the sliders or arrow keys, and zoom in and out.
You can also bring up a grain scale chart to assess the grain size of the rock by comparing the grains on the chart with the rock at full zoom. Note that the sizes and measurements on the chart are only accurate when fully zoomed in on the rock.  A ruler also appears beside the chart when the rock is at the appropriate scale, so you can measure other features of the specimen. Record any observations you make in your notebook.
There is a link to the Virtual Microscope so you can view the rock at the microscopic scale as well.  The microscope opens up in a separate browser window (but Virtual Skiddaw will remain open in the background).
Make notes and sketches in your notebook on any features you can see in the magnified or microscopic views.
Click on Finish when you are done.


Site 1 Blease Fell Quarry Task list
□ Sketch of overall exposure
□ Describe hand specimen of rock in your notebook
□ Describe microscopic aspects of rock in your notebook
□ Check the regional context of the site using the overlays
□ Relate observations to past geological processes


Summary of Site 1 - Blease Fell Quarry
The rocks here are fine-grained, medium to dark grey, weakly metamorphosed mudstones.  They have a fabric composed of numerous closely-spaced planar surfaces but no obvious colour banding, which suggests that this fabric is a fine planar cleavage rather than sedimentary bedding. The rocks could therefore be described as slates.  Fractures are common: many of these are steep joints, but some show striations that indicate minor slip surfaces.
The rocks lack many features you might find in other exposures, such as sedimentary structures, fossils, folds, or visible mineral crystals.  Even with the hand lens you would be lucky to pick out individual mineral grains in this fine-grained rock.
Sedimentary bedding is only easily visible under the microscope, as variations in grain size and colour. The cleavage also shows up, as fine dark lines cutting obliquely across the layering.  The sedimentary layering appears to be folded in places.  On a finer scale, the groundmass of the rock is composed mainly of mineral fragments, but modified by weak metamorphic recrystallization.
The tectonic cleavage is evidence that the rocks have been deformed, while there are only weak indications of metamorphic mineral growth that has not erased the cleavage.  A reasonable interpretation of this evidence is that these rocks have undergone regional metamorphism as a result of continental collision.  There are no signs of contact metamorphism from the Skiddaw Granite.  This is consistent with the fact that Site 1 lies a few kilometres from the nearest surface outcrop of the Skiddaw Granite on the geological map, and in the unaltered zone on the metamorphic zones map.



Site 2 - Blease Beck
You have now arrived at Blease Beck. A short briefing on how to investigate this site will follow.

Site 2 - Blease Beck
Site 2 lies within the outcrop of the same stratigraphic rock unit, the Kirk Stile Formation, as occurs at Site 1.  However, it also lies in a different metamorphic zone, the Spotted slate zone.  How do the rocks here differ from those at Site 1?
An exposure of broken rock dominates Site 2, which is littered with small pieces of rock.  The in situ rock by the side of the track is so heavily fractured that a sketch is not really worthwhile here. Instead, you will gain more insight by studying the textures of the rocks using the hand lens and the virtual microscope. Can you identify any metamorphic minerals or textures?  What about deformation fabrics?
Once you have made your observations, consider what implications they have for the history of these rocks.  For instance, you can constrain the pressure of metamorphism by seeing where any minerals you identify are stable on Phase Diagram 1.

Site 2 Blease Beck Task list
□ State the obvious difference between rocks at Site 1 and Site 2
□ Describe texture and mineralogy of rock under hand lens
□ Describe microscopic aspects of rock (texture, deformation, metamorphism)
□ Identify any evidence for contact memetamorphism
□ Determine maximum pressure of metamorphism by reference to Phase Diagram 1


Summary of Site 2 - Blease Beck
The main contrast with Site 1 is colour: some of the rocks here are reddish, while others have a greenish-grey hue. In many other respects the rocks are similar: fine-grained, and lacking obvious sedimentary layering at outcrop scale. You might be able to recognize traces of slaty cleavage.  The rocks are more fractured here, and the red colour commonly appears to be associated with fractures.
A closer look at the rocks reveals a striking texture of randomly-oriented, white prisms, a few centimetres long. Many of these crystals have rhombic or square end-sections with a dark, square centre. These are large crystals (porphyroblasts) of the metamorphic mineral andalusite that have grown in the metamorphosed mudstone.
Much harder to see are vague oval shapes, a few millimetres across, which are slightly paler than the groundmass of the rock. These are crystals of the metamorphic mineral cordierite.
Under the microscope, the randomly-oriented porphyroblastic texture is clear, though most of the crystals have actually been replaced by fine-grained masses of other minerals. The crystals of both minerals cut across the fine tectonic foliation in the groundmass.
The cleavage provides evidence for the deformation associated with mountain-building and continental collision, but this has been partially overprinted by much more pronounced metamorphic mineral growth.
The random orientation of the metamorphic crystals of andalusite and cordierite strongly suggests heating with no associated deformation, which is characteristic of contact metamorphism of rocks near a cooling igneous body.
Phase Diagram 1 indicates that andalusite is only stable at pressures below about 360 MPa, confirming that the contact metamorphism took place at relatively shallow crustal levels.

Site 3 - Roughton Gill Bridge
You have now arrived at Roughton Gill Bridge. A short briefing on how to investigate this site will follow.

Site 3 - Roughton Gill Bridge
The rocks at Site 3 belong to the same stratigraphic rock unit as those at Site 1 and Site 2: the Kirk Stile Formation. But we are no longer in the Spotted slate zone: Site 3 lies in the Hardened slate zone.
So what has changed in the rocks compared to those at Site 2 to justify placing these rocks in a different zone?
As with Site 2, a sketch is of limited use here, and the most helpful observations you can make will be on hand specimens or microscopic textures using the Virtual Microscope.
Are the metamorphic minerals here the same as at Site 2, or different? Can you find evidence for either sedimentary or tectonic structures?
Before you leave this site, consider the evidence you have gathered here in the context of the geological map of the area, and link your observations to the geological history of these Skiddaw Group rocks.
You can further constrain the conditions of metamorphism by reference to Phase Diagram 2.

Site 3 Roughton Gill Bridge Task list
□ Describe difference between rocks at Site 2 and these rocks.
□ Describe texture and mineralogy of rock under hand lens.
□ Describe microscopic aspects of rock.
□ Identify the two main metamorphic minerals at this locality.
□ Make a precise determination of pressure-temperture conditions using Phase Diagram 2.


Summary of Site 3 - Roughton Gill Bridge
The rocks at this site lack the reddening seen at Site 2, and are mainly medium to dark grey. On closer inspection, the white prismatic crystals of andalusite so abundant at Site 2 are much less common, replaced by prisms of a similar shape and size but dark grey in colour.
However, in many cases the only porphyroblasts visible are vague rounded patches of either slightly darker or lighter grey than the groundmass. Some of these are similar to the oval cordierite crystals at Site 2.
The general texture of the rocks is more granular that at Sites 1 and 2, with little evidence (if any) for the fine slaty cleavage. You may instead see some hints of centimetre-scale banding.
At low magnifications under the microscope, the rock shows bands of different colour and texture, even though the overall texture is granular. This strongly suggests that the banding corresponds to original sedimentary layers. The bands are disrupted by both paler and darker blotches.
At higher magnifications, the groundmass texture of randomly-oriented, interlocking grains can be made out; you might recognize the minerals biotite and quartz.
The numerous pale blobs are cordierite, many of them outlined by small biotite crystals. The irregular darker blotches are large porphyroblasts of andalusite, which appear riddled with holes; in fact the holes are grains of other minerals, mainly quartz, that were engulfed by the andalusite crystal as it grew.
The random, granular texture that has erased the tectonic cleavage is further evidence that contact metamorphism resulting from granite intrusion post-dated regional deformation and metamorphism in the Skiddaw Group.
A granular rock like this one where all other structures have been erased by contact metamorphism is known as a hornfels. Cordierite is present in these rocks, but garnet is not.
Referring to Phase Diagram 2, this implies that none of the cordierite has reacted to form garnet, so the pressures cannot have exceeded about 380400 MPa, depending on the temperature. This confirms the shallow depth of metamorphism deduced from the stability of andalusite.

Site 4 - Large waterfall, Sinel Gill
Two different rock types are exposed at this site: one is generally pale and crumbly, while the other, a hard, splintery rock, occurs in different shades of grey.
Explore the locality, describing each rock type in terms of its texture and mineralogy.
Contrast the different textures you see by making small sketches of typical specimens. Dont forget to check the microscopic textures of both rock-types.
How do your observations here add to the geological story of this area?






Site 4 Summary

The pale rock is a granular, crystalline aggregate of quartz, feldspars and dark flakes of biotite, with no discernible structures or layering: typical of a plutonic igneous rock.

It occurs both as cobbles and boulders in the streambed, and also forms the large waterfall on the upstream side of this site. Since this site lies within the granite outcrop on the geological map, you can be fairly certain that this rock is the Skiddaw Granite.

The grey rock shows a granular texture on weathered surfaces and under the microscope.  It commonly has bands of different colour a few centimetres thick that represent original sedimentary bedding, but there is no visible cleavage. Some quartz veins cross-cut the banding. Both the banding and the veins are folded in places.

Under the microscope, the groundmass texture is granular, with mineralogy varying between biotite-quartz layers and bands with abundant cordierite and andalusite porphyroblasts. Textures are similar to those seen in the cordierite hornfels at Site 3.

The layering in the Skiddaw Group rocks records original sedimentary bedding, which was then cross-cut by quartz veins, perhaps during the early stages of burial and deformation caused by continental collision.  Further deformation folded the bedding(and the veins); this folding event may represent the main phase of mountain-building recorded in these rocks.

The slaty cleavage seen in rocks further from the granite probably formed at the same time as these folds. Last of all, the rocks were contact metamorphosed, growing cordierite, andalusite and biotite in a granular texture that shows the rocks were not deformed during this event.


Site 5 Small waterfall, Sinen Gill
Identify the two main rock types at this site, describe their distribution, and map out any contacts between them. Make a field sketch that shows the form of the contacts between the two rock types, and annotate this as you explore the site further.

Can you recognize any features that indicate whether this contact is intrusive, or faulted?

Summary of Site 5 - Small waterfall, Sinen Gill

The two rock types at this site are the same as those at Site 4: the Skiddaw Granite and a cordierite hornfels formed by contact metamorphism of a Skiddaw Group siltstone. However, at this site the actual contact between the two rocks can be mapped out as a slightly irregular, sub-horizontal surface running along a little above the streambed. 

The hornfels overlies this contact, and the field relations suggest that this site exposes part of the roof of the granite intrusion.  The irregular nature of the contact implies that it is intrusive, and the lack of visible fracturing or brecciation associated with the contact confirms that it is not a fault contact.

Under the microscope, the contact hornfels displays the familiar granular texture.  The mineralogy is similar to the hornfels at Site 3, but quartz is more abundant at Site 5, and there is less cordierite and andalusite.  This does not necessarily indicate a lesser degree of metamorphism.

It is more likely that the original sediment was a more sandy deposit, richer in quartz and poorer in clay minerals, so that there was less aluminium available to fuel the growth of cordierite or andalusite.  Allowing for this compositional variation, the texture and mineralogy are otherwise typical for a contact metamorphosed hornfels adjacent to a granite intrusion.



Site 5 - Small waterfall, Sinen Gill Task List
Make a labelled sketch of the north bank up to the small waterfall
Identify the two rock types exposed in contact along the north bank and waterfall
Describe the nature of the contact (sharpness, regularity)
Which aluminosilicate should form in the country rock here? Use Phase Diagram 3, and assume the granite magma was at 700˚C.


Site 6 - School House Quarry
School House quarry is the largest exposure in the area, so there is more to investigate here than at the other sites. Start with a sketch of the whole quarry face to highlight the main features. As you explore the site, you can key your critical observations into this sketch.

There are a number of features visible here, including tectonic fabrics and a pair of minor igneous intrusions. Using your sketch to guide you, describe as many features as you can find and try to identify what they are.

Then examine the relationships between the different features: do they cross-cut each other systematically? 

Can you determine whether one feature post-dates another?

Note any evidence you find for the relative timing of different features, and use your observations to construct a table of chronological events and processes that affected these rocks.



Site 6 School House Quarry Task list
Sketch the exposure
Describe any structural fabrics and features, then annotate your sketch
Note any other features (e.g. veins, bedding, intrusions)
Construct a timeline showing when the features formed relative to each other.



Summary of Site 6 - School House Quarry
School House quarry exploited the Loweswater Formation of the Skiddaw Group. The lower quarry face exposes dark grey mudstones with a prominent tectonic cleavage that is steeply dipping or vertical. This cleavage is gently warped, so both northerly and southerly dips occur in the quarry.

Bedding is only barely visible at the extreme western end of the quarry, as subtle bands of colour and grain-size variation. Like the cleavage, it is also steeply-dipping, which may explain why it is so difficult to make out.

In the centre of the main quarry face are two low-angle faults that dip gently north.  The warped cleavage next to these faults indicates that the hanging wall of the main thrust was displaced to the south. The cleavage is both warped and cut by the thrust faults, so the thrusting post-dated cleavage formation. 

Some quartz-filled veins occur, many of them gently-dipping. Towards the eastern end of the quarry, several veins are concentrated within two bands of rock that are more competent than the surrounding slate. Each band is about half a metre wide, and they are oriented sub-parallel to the steep cleavage, dipping steeply south. These bands are sheets of mafic igneous rock (quartz dolerite) that intruded the slates.

Fractures are common throughout the quarry. One conspicuous set dips gently to the north-west, and can be seen to cut across the dolerite contacts, so this fracturing post-dated intrusion of the dolerite. There is one example of a quartz vein obliquely cutting one of these fractures, implying that the veins were formed after the gently-dipping fractures. Steep faults trending north-south offset one of the dolerite sheets near the eastern end of the quarry.


Using the evidence at this site, the following brief geological history can be reconstructed:

 - First, deposition of mudstones in an early Ordovician ocean basin;

 - Second, either intrusion of quartz dolerite sheets as sills, or formation of the slaty cleavage. This is difficult to resolve without further information.  For instance, vesicles in the dolerite and the age of similar intrusions in the region suggest that intrusion pre-dated cleavage formation;

 - Formation of the steep slaty cleavage occurred during regional horizontal compression associated with continental collision and mountain building;

 - Next, southward thrust faulting of the cleaved slates, with related warping.  The gently-dipping fractures probably also occurred at this time;

 - Then, formation of the brittle quartz veins (particularly in the competent dolerite sheets) by later horizontal compression;

 - The steep faults at the eastern end of the quarry are most likely one of the latest features, cross-cutting many other structures.

 - Finally, uplift and erosion of the rocks to their present position, with formation of joints caused by stress release.
