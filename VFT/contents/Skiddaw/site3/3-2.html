<p>
  The rocks at Site 3 belong to the same stratigraphic rock unit as those at Site 1 and Site 2: the Kirk Stile Formation. But we are no longer in the Spotted slate zone: Site 3 lies in the Hardened slate zone.
  So what has changed in the rocks compared to those at Site 2 to justify placing these rocks in a different zone?
  As with Site 2, a sketch is of limited use here, and the most helpful observations you can make will be on hand specimens or microscopic textures using the Virtual Microscope.
  Are the metamorphic minerals here the same as at Site 2, or different? Can you find evidence for either sedimentary or tectonic structures?
  Before you leave this site, consider the evidence you have gathered here in the context of the geological map of the area, and link your observations to the geological history of these Skiddaw Group rocks.
  You can further constrain the conditions of metamorphism by reference to Phase Diagram 2.
