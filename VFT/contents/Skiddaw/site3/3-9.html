  The rocks at this site lack the reddening seen at Site 2, and are mainly medium to dark grey. On closer inspection, the white prismatic crystals of andalusite so abundant at Site 2 are much less common, replaced by prisms of a similar shape and size but dark grey in colour.
  However, in many cases the only porphyroblasts visible are vague rounded patches of either slightly darker or lighter grey than the groundmass. Some of these are similar to the oval cordierite crystals at Site 2.
  The general texture of the rocks is more granular that at Sites 1 and 2, with little evidence (if any) for the fine slaty cleavage. You may instead see some hints of centimetre-scale banding.
  At low magnifications under the microscope, the rock shows bands of different colour and texture, even though the overall texture is granular. This strongly suggests that the banding corresponds to original sedimentary layers. The bands are disrupted by both paler and darker blotches.
  At higher magnifications, the groundmass texture of randomly-oriented, interlocking grains can be made out; you might recognize the minerals biotite and quartz.
  The numerous pale blobs are cordierite, many of them outlined by small biotite crystals. The irregular darker blotches are large porphyroblasts of andalusite, which appear riddled with holes; in fact the holes are grains of other minerals, mainly quartz, that were engulfed by the andalusite crystal as it grew.
  The random, granular texture that has erased the tectonic cleavage is further evidence that contact metamorphism resulting from granite intrusion post-dated regional deformation and metamorphism in the Skiddaw Group.
  A granular rock like this one where all other structures have been erased by contact metamorphism is known as a hornfels. Cordierite is present in these rocks, but garnet is not.
  Referring to Phase Diagram 2, this implies that none of the cordierite has reacted to form garnet, so the pressures cannot have exceeded about 380400 MPa, depending on the temperature. This confirms the shallow depth of metamorphism deduced from the stability of andalusite.
