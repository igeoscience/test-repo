  The pale rock is a granular, crystalline aggregate of quartz, feldspars and dark flakes of biotite, with no discernible structures or layering: typical of a plutonic igneous rock.

  It occurs both as cobbles and boulders in the streambed, and also forms the large waterfall on the upstream side of this site. Since this site lies within the granite outcrop on the geological map, you can be fairly certain that this rock is the Skiddaw Granite.

  The grey rock shows a granular texture on weathered surfaces and under the microscope.  It commonly has bands of different colour a few centimetres thick that represent original sedimentary bedding, but there is no visible cleavage. Some quartz veins cross-cut the banding. Both the banding and the veins are folded in places.

  Under the microscope, the groundmass texture is granular, with mineralogy varying between biotite-quartz layers and bands with abundant cordierite and andalusite porphyroblasts. Textures are similar to those seen in the cordierite hornfels at Site 3.

  The layering in the Skiddaw Group rocks records original sedimentary bedding, which was then cross-cut by quartz veins, perhaps during the early stages of burial and deformation caused by continental collision.  Further deformation folded the bedding(and the veins); this folding event may represent the main phase of mountain-building recorded in these rocks.

  The slaty cleavage seen in rocks further from the granite probably formed at the same time as these folds. Last of all, the rocks were contact metamorphosed, growing cordierite, andalusite and biotite in a granular texture that shows the rocks were not deformed during this event.
