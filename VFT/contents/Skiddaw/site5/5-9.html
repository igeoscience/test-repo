  The two rock types at this site are the same as those at Site 4: the Skiddaw Granite and a cordierite hornfels formed by contact metamorphism of a Skiddaw Group siltstone. However, at this site the actual contact between the two rocks can be mapped out as a slightly irregular, sub-horizontal surface running along a little above the streambed.

  The hornfels overlies this contact, and the field relations suggest that this site exposes part of the roof of the granite intrusion.  The irregular nature of the contact implies that it is intrusive, and the lack of visible fracturing or brecciation associated with the contact confirms that it is not a fault contact.

  Under the microscope, the contact hornfels displays the familiar granular texture.  The mineralogy is similar to the hornfels at Site 3, but quartz is more abundant at Site 5, and there is less cordierite and andalusite.  This does not necessarily indicate a lesser degree of metamorphism.

  It is more likely that the original sediment was a more sandy deposit, richer in quartz and poorer in clay minerals, so that there was less aluminium available to fuel the growth of cordierite or andalusite.  Allowing for this compositional variation, the texture and mineralogy are otherwise typical for a contact metamorphosed hornfels adjacent to a granite intrusion.
