<h1>Skiddaw</h1>
  <p>
    There are two main types of rock in the Skiddaw field area: a pile of sedimentary rocks known as the Skiddaw Group, and a single igneous rock, the Skiddaw granite, that intruded those sedimentary rocks around 400 million years ago. The Skiddaw Group was deposited on the seafloor of the Iapetus Ocean nearly half a billion years ago as a thick succession of mudstones, siltstones and gritty sandstones. These sediments were eroded from a small continent called Avalonia, which lay just to the south.  </p>
  <p>
    Not long after the sediments were laid down, the Iapetus Ocean narrowed and then closed completely, as Avalonia collided with another continent called Laurentia, forming a range of mountains. The Skiddaw Group rocks were caught in the middle of this collision. They were deformed, buried several kilometres deep and gradually heated up. The mudstones changed into slates as a result of this regional metamorphism.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the collision, molten rock rose from deep in the crust as magma and intruded the Skiddaw Group slates.  The magma cooled and crystallized, forming the Skiddaw Granite.  As the magma cooled, it lost heat into the nearby Skiddaw Group sedimentary rocks.  This heat caused new minerals to grow in the sedimentary rocks, a process known as contact metamorphism.

    You can gather detailed evidence from exposures in this environment to explore:
    - First, the effects of contact and regional metamorphism of the Skiddaw Group sedimentary rocks;
    - Second, how the Skiddaw Group rocks were deformed during the mountain-building event.
