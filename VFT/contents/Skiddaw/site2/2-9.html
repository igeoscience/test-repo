  The main contrast with Site 1 is colour: some of the rocks here are reddish, while others have a greenish-grey hue. In many other respects the rocks are similar: fine-grained, and lacking obvious sedimentary layering at outcrop scale. You might be able to recognize traces of slaty cleavage.  The rocks are more fractured here, and the red colour commonly appears to be associated with fractures.
  A closer look at the rocks reveals a striking texture of randomly-oriented, white prisms, a few centimetres long. Many of these crystals have rhombic or square end-sections with a dark, square centre. These are large crystals (porphyroblasts) of the metamorphic mineral andalusite that have grown in the metamorphosed mudstone.
  Much harder to see are vague oval shapes, a few millimetres across, which are slightly paler than the groundmass of the rock. These are crystals of the metamorphic mineral cordierite.
  Under the microscope, the randomly-oriented porphyroblastic texture is clear, though most of the crystals have actually been replaced by fine-grained masses of other minerals. The crystals of both minerals cut across the fine tectonic foliation in the groundmass.
  The cleavage provides evidence for the deformation associated with mountain-building and continental collision, but this has been partially overprinted by much more pronounced metamorphic mineral growth.
  The random orientation of the metamorphic crystals of andalusite and cordierite strongly suggests heating with no associated deformation, which is characteristic of contact metamorphism of rocks near a cooling igneous body.
  Phase Diagram 1 indicates that andalusite is only stable at pressures below about 360 MPa, confirming that the contact metamorphism took place at relatively shallow crustal levels.
