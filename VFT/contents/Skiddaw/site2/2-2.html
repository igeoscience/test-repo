  Site 2 lies within the outcrop of the same stratigraphic rock unit, the Kirk Stile Formation, as occurs at Site 1.  However, it also lies in a different metamorphic zone, the Spotted slate zone.  How do the rocks here differ from those at Site 1?
  An exposure of broken rock dominates Site 2, which is littered with small pieces of rock.  The in situ rock by the side of the track is so heavily fractured that a sketch is not really worthwhile here. Instead, you will gain more insight by studying the textures of the rocks using the hand lens and the virtual microscope. Can you identify any metamorphic minerals or textures?  What about deformation fabrics?
  Once you have made your observations, consider what implications they have for the history of these rocks.  For instance, you can constrain the pressure of metamorphism by seeing where any minerals you identify are stable on Phase Diagram 1.
