<p>
  School House quarry is the largest exposure in the area, so there is more to investigate here than at the other sites. Start with a sketch of the whole quarry face to highlight the main features. As you explore the site, you can key your critical observations into this sketch.

  There are a number of features visible here, including tectonic fabrics and a pair of minor igneous intrusions. Using your sketch to guide you, describe as many features as you can find and try to identify what they are.

  Then examine the relationships between the different features: do they cross-cut each other systematically?

  Can you determine whether one feature post-dates another?

  Note any evidence you find for the relative timing of different features, and use your observations to construct a table of chronological events and processes that affected these rocks.
