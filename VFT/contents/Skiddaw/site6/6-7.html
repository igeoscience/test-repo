  School House quarry exploited the Loweswater Formation of the Skiddaw Group. The lower quarry face exposes dark grey mudstones with a prominent tectonic cleavage that is steeply dipping or vertical. This cleavage is gently warped, so both northerly and southerly dips occur in the quarry.

  Bedding is only barely visible at the extreme western end of the quarry, as subtle bands of colour and grain-size variation. Like the cleavage, it is also steeply-dipping, which may explain why it is so difficult to make out.

  In the centre of the main quarry face are two low-angle faults that dip gently north.  The warped cleavage next to these faults indicates that the hanging wall of the main thrust was displaced to the south. The cleavage is both warped and cut by the thrust faults, so the thrusting post-dated cleavage formation.

  Some quartz-filled veins occur, many of them gently-dipping. Towards the eastern end of the quarry, several veins are concentrated within two bands of rock that are more competent than the surrounding slate. Each band is about half a metre wide, and they are oriented sub-parallel to the steep cleavage, dipping steeply south. These bands are sheets of mafic igneous rock (quartz dolerite) that intruded the slates.

  Fractures are common throughout the quarry. One conspicuous set dips gently to the north-west, and can be seen to cut across the dolerite contacts, so this fracturing post-dated intrusion of the dolerite. There is one example of a quartz vein obliquely cutting one of these fractures, implying that the veins were formed after the gently-dipping fractures. Steep faults trending north-south offset one of the dolerite sheets near the eastern end of the quarry.

  Using the evidence at this site, the following brief geological history can be reconstructed:
<ul>
<li>First, deposition of mudstones in an early Ordovician ocean basin;</li>
<li>Second, either intrusion of quartz dolerite sheets as sills, or formation of the slaty cleavage. This is difficult to resolve without further information.  For instance, vesicles in the dolerite and the age of similar intrusions in the region suggest that intrusion pre-dated cleavage formation;</li>
<li>Formation of the steep slaty cleavage occurred during regional horizontal compression associated with continental collision and mountain building;</li>
<li>Next, southward thrust faulting of the cleaved slates, with related warping.  The gently-dipping fractures probably also occurred at this time;</li>
<li>Then, formation of the brittle quartz veins (particularly in the competent dolerite sheets) by later horizontal compression;</li>
<li>The steep faults at the eastern end of the quarry are most likely one of the latest features, cross-cutting many other structures.</li>
<li>Finally, uplift and erosion of the rocks to their present position, with formation of joints caused by stress release.</li>
</ul>
