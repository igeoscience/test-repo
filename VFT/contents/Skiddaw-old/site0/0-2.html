<h1>Welcome to Virtual Skiddaw</h1>
  <p>
  Welcome to the Skiddaw landscape, a virtual chunk of the northern English Lake District for you to explore, on the ground or from the air.  Browse through the map overlays, cruise around the whole area, or dip down to visit geological sites for detailed observations on the geology.  View the rocks at all scales from a field sketch down to a slide under the microscope.
  But before you begin your investigations you need to dress for the occasion, picking up some vital (virtual) equipment to take with you.
